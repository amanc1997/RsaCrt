# Comparison of computation time in RSA Cryptography Algorithm with and without CRT

•	Chinese Remainder Theorem is a theorem that is widely applicable in cryptography. It can often be used to speed up the computations.
•	Implemented RSA algorithm in Java using Chinese remainder theorem. 
•	Calculated and did a comparison study on computation time of the RSA algorithm.
